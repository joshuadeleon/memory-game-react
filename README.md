# Memory Game
This is a version of the memory game used in the book 
[React Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/details/ebooks/Reactjs_Succinctly). 
It's purpose was to begin to understand javascript library React, not necessary how
I'd write production code or set up a javascript environment for code release

## Technologies
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) via CDN
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) via CDN
- [Babel standalone](https://github.com/Daniel15/babel-standalone) via CDN

Locally, I used [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) with the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
package and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) for windows. Lately, I've used 
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my code editor for non .NET projects 
and [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) for my console needs.

### Notes
- I did not implement the 10 second timer. 
- I attempted a version of replay. The book implements a better version. 
- I have not yet tried the additional problems, and may never.
