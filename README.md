# Memory Game
This is a version of the memory game used in the book 
[React Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/details/ebooks/Reactjs_Succinctly). 
It's purpose was to begin to understand javascript library React. 

### Notes
- I did not implement the 10 second timer. 
- I attempted a version of replay. The book implements a better version. 
- I have not yet tried the additional problems, and may never.
